This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and attempting to render a large number of items.  The issue is that React Native's FlatList has a performance limitation when dealing with a significant amount of data.  This can lead to slow rendering times, dropped frames, and overall jankiness in the UI.  The problem becomes more pronounced when each item is computationally expensive to render.
